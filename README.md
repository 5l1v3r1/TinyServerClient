# TinyServerClient
Small tcp server and client for testing.

This repository contains only two files:

    * tinyserver.py - Small multi-threaded server, with configurable port, number of clients, 
                      buffer size, and message to receive that kills the process.
                      
    * tinyclient.py - Client to use with tinyserver.py and to be able to do communication tests. 
                      It also allows you to configure the host, port and message to send.
      

These modules have been used for the execution of tests of another project that is currently underway (August / 2019), and is not finished.

Please feel free to contact me if you wish to make any suggestions or send me any comments.

If you use this code or part of it for any project of yours, I would like to hear from it.

I will be glad to know that it has been useful to you.
