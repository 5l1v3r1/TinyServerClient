## [1.0.1] - 2019-08-07
### Added
- Start using "CHANGELOG.md"
- Added folder old_versions and moved older versions with subfolders here.


### Changed
- Start versioning based on the current version at 1.0.1 
- Small changes in the README.md
- In some mixed string formatting I substitute the use of % and concatenate variables with the use of format().
- I replace the double quotes with single quotes in some strings. Simply by homogeneity throughout the code.
